// q3d - a boneless 3d object format for asset exchange.

// Vaguely inspired by the Lowest Common Denominator of 3d files, STL.
// This format is extensible within the bounds of what FlatBuffers offer.
// However, such exensions are fundamentally incompatible with upstream 'q3d'
// files, as extension identifiers may clash with other extensions. As such,
// we kindly ask to not claim q3d compatibility if such extensions are in use
// by your application, and instead either wrap the top-level Object in your
// own FlatBuffer IDL, or upstream your required changes.
